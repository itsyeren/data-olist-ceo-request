🏋️‍♀️ Time to answer our CEO's request!

## Problem

>❓ Considering that Olist has the following, how many low-performing sellers should it remove from the system to increase its profit?
> - Some monthly revenue per seller
> - Some revenue per order
> - Some (estimated) reputation costs per bad review
> - IT system operational costs that increase with the number of order items but are non-linear (scale effects)

- You may want to first calculate the review cost per order and then sum these costs per seller.

## ✏️ Your turn!

👉 **Open the **CEO_request.ipynb** notebook and start there.**

- We will start with a new Notebook
- Do not reuse previous notebooks – they were prepared for review purposes only
- All your reusable logic is coded in the **olist/*.py** scripts
