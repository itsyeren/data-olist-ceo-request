    "\n",
    "💡 In the long term, poor customer experience leads to business consequences: low repeat purchase rate, immediate customer support costs, refunds, or negative word-of-mouth communication. We assume a monetary cost for each bad review:\n",

    "💡 However, the use of square root shows scale-effects: IT systems tend to become more efficient as they grow.\n",
